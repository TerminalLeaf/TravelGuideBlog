        <h4>A Weekend on the Seine</h4>
        <p>I was lucky enough to spend three days visiting Paris this month! I went with a friend and we were able to see many things while we were there!</p>
        <p>Click <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris" target="_blank">here</a> to learn more about paris!</p>
        <h5 id="day1">Day 1</h5>
        <p>On our first day, we started by visiting <em>Montmarte</em> right away. Our second stop was the Eiffel Tower (check out that beautiful picture!) We ate dinner at a cute little bistro overlooking <em>la Seine</em>.</p>
        <h5 id="day2">Day 2</h5>
        <p>On our second day, we went shopping on <em>Avenue des Champs Elysees</em>. Every single person we saw was dressed in the height of fashion.<br><br> After we finished shopping, we visited some really beautiful places! We went to <em>Notre Dame</em>. We went off on a maracon tour of Paris and ate all the best macarons the city had to offer. After we finished shopping, we visited <em>le Louvre</em>.</p>
        <h5 id="day3">Day 3</h5>
        <p>The picture below is me visiting the <em>Arc De Triomphe</em>. It's huge! We also went to <em>le Musee Dâ€™Orsay</em>. Seeing the work of Renoir, Monet, and Van Gogh in person was completely breathtaking. I was surprised to see that the museum also had many sculptures including those by Augustine Robin, Paul Gauguin, and Alfred Barye</p>
